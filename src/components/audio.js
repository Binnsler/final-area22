            <h3 className="">Pre-Production</h3>
            <p className="paragraph pad-20">This stage happens before you start to record your music. This is when the lyrics, chords, melody and arrangement are fleshed out and finalized. Basic instrumentation is used to get an organic feel of your song. Song charts can be created as a guide for the musicians to use while recording.</p>
            <h3 className="">Production</h3>
            <p className="paragraph pad-20">This is when the tracks are recorded. The rhythm tracks are recorded first. The rhythm track normally consists of your primary instrumentation, e.g: guitar, bass, keyboards and drums. If your songs do not call for a live drummer, a drum beat can be programmed for you using our drum machine or drum loops. The vocalist can record his/her lead vocal at the same time to match the fluidity of the band, or record it afterward. All extra instrumentation/vocals will be added after your rhythm track is finished. This can be auxiliary percussion, guitar parts, keyboard parts, string parts, background vocals, etc. Whatever you envision your song to have, we can make it happen!</p>
            <h3 className="">Mixing</h3>
            <div className="paragraph pad-20">
              <p>This process includes panning, EQ (equalization), effects and automation of the instruments.</p>
              <p>Panning: When we listen to music, there are instruments we hear on the left side, right side, and straight in middle of the mix. With panning, the engineer will decide where to place each instrument for clarity of sound. This allows for all instruments to be heard without getting buried beneath layers of tracks. The sound is balanced between the left and right channels, for an optimized listening experience. EQ: Layering multiple tracks upon each other will most likely give you a muddy sound if not EQed properly. The engineer will adjust the high, mid, and low frequencies to ensure a clear sound for each instrument.</p>
              <p>Effects: We use a combination of vintage analog processing equipment and advanced digital-audio workstation plug-ins to bring your sonic dream to life. Reverb, delay, compression and chorus effects, etc., are customized to fit the sound you wish to achieve for your songs. Automation includes adjusting levels of the different sections of your song. For example, a certain keyboard melody may need to be higher in the chorus, while a rhythm guitar part needs to be more prevalent in the verses. The engineer will adjust levels accordingly. Because each song has a certain character and personality it wishes to convey, that character will get fleshed out during the mixing process.</p>

              <h3 className="">Mastering</h3>
              <div className="paragraph pad-20">
                <p>After you have mixed your audio project, there is a final step to bring it to the mainstream level. This step is called mastering. Several details are addressed in this final process before releasing it to the public. The engineers will strive to sonically enhance your audio product while preserving artistic integrity. Mastering will:</p>
                <ol>
                  <li>Ensure compatibility/playability of your project for consumer products such as CD players, iPods, MP3 players, as well as radio station broadcasts and digital streaming.</li>
                  <li>Provide sonic enhancements such as bass and treble response, stereo imaging, loudness and overall dynamic range.</li>
                  <li>Involve encoding of digital ownership codes and other data within the audio product which allows your song to be identified by the music industry and consumer.</li>
                  <li>Ensures your product is sonically competitive with what the industry releases.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Our engineers have mastered MTV and Billboard charting songs. We have developed a reputation for technical excellence and creative innovation in the art of audio mastering. Other facilities run a normalizer type of volume boost and call it mastering--that's not how we do it at Area Twenty-Two. We take each artist's audio program and customize the mastering based on what the artist wants, what the industry demands and what the songs command. Mastering is an art form that takes dedicated craftsmanship to bring it to a mind-blowing level. Our engineers have over 30 years of mastering experience—you can be assured we can make your product shine.</p>

              <h1 className="vert-pad-20">What is Ana-Digi?</h1>
              <div className="paragraph pad-20">
                <p>Ana-Digi is an audio recording process created and pioneered by audio engineer / record producer Bob Yen Jr. over a period of three decades. Most audio production today is done by a completely digital process, which is perfect for advertising, commercials, and the like. It is sacrilege to record something that has soul, such as music being made by human beings (as opposed to just a bunch of synthesizers and digital sample loops) using digital production.</p>

                <p>The digital domain is cold, lonely, sterile and devoid of any soul in terms of how it ultimately holds sound - in barren zeros and ones. Why anyone would want to purposely attempt to capture a soulful event in this way is beyond belief.</p>

                <p>When all music used to be recorded on analog medium (tape), there was a certain warmth, expansion, saturation and soulfully sweet characteristic in the sound recording. It was always taken for granted that the soulful zen sound would always be there because that’s all there was. Analog tape machines and the supporting analog equipment (such as tube amps, tube compressors and tube equalization) were all that was used to make recordings and therefore music.</p>

                <p>The efficiency in editing and overall lower cost of the digital recording process has slowly, but firmly taken over how sound is recorded today. Initially the digital process was seen as a very sub standard audio experience, due to its coldness and harshness. But, as is often the case, the economics (cheaper operating costs and quickness in outputting audio product), has won over the music industry as the prefered platform with which to produce music today.</p>

                <p>Bob Yen Jr. realized that the editing in the digital domain was a very useful tool, but the audio product suffered in the overall sound quality. This realization inspired him to research ways to re-capture that forgotten soulful sound experience. </p>

                <p>One of the main components removed in the digital recording process was the use of analog tape which, while having great recording characteristics (better harmonic capturing and overall depth of sound), was very expensive, had poor shelf life (a tape only lasts for several years) and was difficult to edit. Instead of simply accepting the new digital format, Bob continued to experiment in how to capture what normally could only be captured on analog tape - without using analog tape. By using analog tube microphones, tube compressors, tube equalizers, high performance (hot rodded) mic pre’s and other related analog gear, Bob was able to find a formula that gave the warmth of analog, while allowing for the great editing capacities of digital.</p>

                <p>Bob named his new technique Ana-Digi.</p>
