            <h4 className="">Have you developed an interest in audio engineering?</h4>
            <p className="paragraph pad-20">This course will introduce you to the basics of the art and science of the craft. While audio engineering is an extremely competitive field, many have found it to be highly rewarding work. Those that develop the discipline to wrack up many years of recording experience often can (and do) develop part-time, or even full-time careers. This course will show you what audio engineering is, and what it can be.</p>
            <h4 className="">Meet Chuck - Your Engineering Coach</h4>
            <p className="paragraph pad-20">My name is Chuck Vermette Jr. I have been a musician for the majority of my life, and have spent the better half of it dedicated to the art of creating recordings professionally. Following the release of my first full length album as engineer, I was trained for several years by my mentor and friend Bob Yen Jr. I have done recordings for CBS programming, and have also been a Mix-down and recording engineer for multiple Grammy nominated projects. I continue to hone my skills, and develop my craft as both the Engineer for Area Twenty-Two, and the Technician for the recording projects of Johnny "Drama" Alves (of Wahlburger's on A&E). In this course I will show you all the basic knowledge and technical skill you would require to operate as an audio engineer, and also give you the opportunity to use and observe the behavior of professional audio equipment used by high-end studios all over the world. I believe that learning should be an engaging and eye-opening experience, and would encourage all students to bring a notebook, and some form of digital recorder (iPhone, for instance) to each class.</p>
            <h4 className="">The Course</h4>
            <div className="paragraph pad-20">
              <p>While we will be covering how to work with audio using a digital workstation, we will also be discussing more universal "outside the box" aspects of recording and processing audio related to acoustics, equipment, and recording studio protocol. You will learn about: Signal Flow, Studio Gear, Frequencies, Microphones, Speakers, Recording consoles, Compressors, Equalizers, Reverb, Recording and Mixing with analog gear, Recording, Editing, and Mixing with Digital Audio Workstations, Mastering, and "reverse engineering" recordings.</p>

              <h4 className="">Digital Audio Workstations</h4>
              <div className="paragraph pad-20">
                <p>Nearly all contemporary professional audio work is done in digital formats (.WAV, .AIFF, .MP3, .M4A, etc.). Hence, the vast majority of audio work in general is (as both professionals and hobbyists would call it) "inside the box", or is done by manipulation of data via digital audio workstations (viz. programs and apps like Pro Tools, Logic, Ableton, Cubase, Reason, Reaper, Studio One, Adobe Audition, FL Studio, GarageBand, Audacity, etc.). In this course, we will primarily be using the industry standard choice, Avid's Pro Tools. It is to be noted though, that while we will be using Pro Tools to demonstrate the capabilities of modern digital audio workstations, if the student has a digital audio workstation (on their laptop, for instance,) they are permitted to bring that workstation with them to class, and I will address any material covered in the class in relation to the student's digital audio workstation if such is requested.</p>
